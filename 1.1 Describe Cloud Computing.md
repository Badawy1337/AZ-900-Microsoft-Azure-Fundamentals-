Describe Cloud Computing:
  Cloud computing is a model for enabling universal, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction
  Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, expands traditional IT offerings to include services like: 
	Internet of Things (IOT)
    Machine Learning (ML)
    Artificial Intellegence (AI)
  Cloud computing enables organizations to quickly expand their compute footprint without the need to build a datacenter

The Shared Responsibility Model:
  In an on-premises datacenter, you own the whole stack. As you move to the cloud some responsibilities transfer to Microsoft. The following diagram illustrates the areas of responsibility between you and Microsoft, according to the type of deployment of your stack

  Regardless of the type of deployment, you always retain the following responsibilities:
    Data
    Endpoints
    Accounts
    Access Management
  The following diagram shows a traditional approach where many security responsibilities are unmet due to limited resources. In the cloud-enabled approach, you're able to shift day to day security responsibilities to your cloud provider and reallocate your resources.
